## Introduction
This is an AI model using the Machine Learning, Image Processing which involved repeatedly gesturing in front of a camera to teach the system the fundamentals of sign language. This is to combat the differences between various Countryâ€™s sign languages and their regional dialects without compromising on accuracy while giving way to crowd-sourcing.


## Intermediate Outputs
The outputs below were taken directly from our model.
#### RAW Feed (1920x1080 @ 60 fps)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Things you need to run the program:
- Python Compiler (3.7 Recommended)
- A clone of this repository :P
- **Easy Way:** Install all the necessary packages form pypi by using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirement.txt
  ```
- If you still prefer the old fashioned way, then use the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numpy
    pip install tqdm
    ```
